# MM-GRPO
An easy-to-use and fast library to support RL training for multi-modal generative models, built on top of verl, vLLM, and diffusers.


## Key Features

- Easy to integrate diverse RL training algorithms for MM generative models, including FlowGRPO and MixedGRPO
- Scalable and efficient parallel training with asynchronous streaming workflow and ED disaggregation.
- Compatible with diffusion models in `Diffusers`.
